        <h2>What Exactly is Amazon EC2?</h2>
        <p>Amazon EC2 is a cloud computing web service that provides resizable computational power. It provides customers with the ability to rent virtual computers (known as instances) to execute programs and manage workloads. EC2 instances may be established, scaled, and terminated fast as needed, allowing organisations to adjust to changing demands without incurring the upfront costs and hassles of managing actual hardware.</p>
