    <h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2>
    <p>Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) is a service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that simplifies the process of provisioning, managing, and deploying Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) certificates for use with AWS services and resources. SSL/TLS certificates are essential for encrypting data in transit and ensuring secure communication between clients and servers.</p>

    <h2>How it works?</h2>
    <p>Amazon Certificate Manager (ACM) simplifies the process of securing web applications and services by providing a managed solution for obtaining, deploying, and renewing SSL/TLS certificates. To start, users request a certificate through the ACM console or APIs, specifying the domain names for which the certificate is needed. ACM then validates ownership of the specified domains through email validation or DNS validation. Once validated, ACM issues the certificate, and it is securely stored within ACM. One of the key advantages of ACM is its fully managed lifecycle; it automates the renewal process, ensuring that certificates are updated before expiration.</p>
    <p>ACM certificates seamlessly integrate with various AWS services. For instance, they can be associated with Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs), CloudFront distributions, or API Gateway, allowing for secure communication across different AWS components. ACM's integration ensures that the certificates are automatically deployed to the associated services, streamlining the deployment process. Additionally, ACM provides visibility into the certificate status, including expiration dates, through the AWS Management Console. The service supports wildcard certificates, making it easy to secure multiple subdomains under a single certificate. ACM's automatic renewal, ease of integration, and comprehensive management make it an efficient and convenient solution for users to implement and maintain SSL/TLS certificates across their AWS infrastructure.</p>
