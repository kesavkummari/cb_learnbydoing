    <h1>AWS Lambda </h1>

    <div class="section">
      
        <p>
            AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources, including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling, and logging. With Lambda, all you need to do is supply your code in one of the language runtimes that Lambda supports.
        </p>
        <p>
            You organize your code into Lambda functions, and Lambda runs your function only when needed and scales automatically.
            You only pay for the compute time that you consumeâ€”there is no charge when your code is not running.
            For more information, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/" target="_blank">AWS Lambda Pricing</a>.

        <h2>When to use Lambda</h2>
        <p>
            Lambda is an ideal compute service for application scenarios that need to scale up rapidly, and scale down to zero when not in demand.
            For example, you can use Lambda for:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>File processing: Use Amazon S3 to trigger Lambda data processing in real time after an upload.</li>
            <li>Stream processing: Use Lambda and Amazon Kinesis for real-time streaming data processing.</li>
            <li>Web applications: Combine Lambda with other AWS services to build powerful web applications.</li>
            <li>IoT backends: Build serverless backends using Lambda to handle web, mobile, IoT, and third-party API requests.</li>
            <li>Mobile backends: Build backends using Lambda and Amazon API Gateway to authenticate and process API requests.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            When using Lambda, you are responsible only for your code. Lambda manages the compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources to run your code. Because Lambda manages these resources, you cannot log in to compute instances or customize the operating system on provided runtimes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lambda performs operational and administrative activities on your behalf, including managing capacity, monitoring, and logging your Lambda functions.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do need to manage your compute resources, AWS has other compute services to consider, such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS App Runner builds and deploys containerized web applications automatically, load balances traffic with encryption, scales to meet your traffic needs, and allows for the configuration of how services are accessed and communicate with other AWS applications in a private Amazon VPC.</li>
            <li>AWS Fargate with Amazon ECS runs containers without having to provision, configure, or scale clusters of virtual machines.</li>
            <li>Amazon EC2 lets you customize operating system, network and security settings, and the entire software stack. You are responsible for provisioning capacity, monitoring fleet health and performance, and using Availability Zones for fault tolerance.</li>
            </ul>
