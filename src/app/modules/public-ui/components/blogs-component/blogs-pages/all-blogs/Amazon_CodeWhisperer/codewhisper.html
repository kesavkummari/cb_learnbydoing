                <p>57% faster | 27% more likely to succeed</p>
                <p>Amazon ran a productivity challenge during the preview, and participants who used CodeWhisperer were 27% more likely to complete tasks successfully and did so an average of 57% faster than those who did not use CodeWhisperer.</p>

            <p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codewhisperer/" target="_blank" title="Go to Amazon_CodeWhisperer">Amazon CodeWhisperer</a> is an AI-powered productivity tool that generates real-time, single-line or full-function code suggestions in your integrated development environment (IDE) and in the command line to help you quickly build software.</p>
            <p>With CodeWhisperer, you can write a comment in natural language that outlines a specific task in English, such as, “Upload a file with server-side encryption.” Based on this information, CodeWhisperer recommends one or more code snippets directly in the IDE that can accomplish the task.</p>
            <p>You can quickly and easily accept the top suggestion (tab key), view more suggestions (arrow keys), or continue writing your own code. You should always review a code suggestion before accepting it, and you might need to edit it to ensure that it does exactly what you intended.</p>
            <p>For more information, see the User Guides for Visual Studio (VS) Code and JetBrains, AWS Cloud9, the AWS Lambda console, JupyterLab, and Amazon SageMaker Studio, Command line, and Visual Studio (preview).</p>
