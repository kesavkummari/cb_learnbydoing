        <p>
            Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes your incoming traffic across multiple targets, such as EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses, in one or more Availability Zones.
            It monitors the health of its registered targets and routes traffic only to the healthy targets.
            Elastic Load Balancing scales your load balancer capacity automatically in response to changes in incoming traffic.

        <h2>Load Balancer Benefits</h2>
        <p>
            <p>A load balancer distributes workloads across multiple compute resources, such as virtual servers. Using a load balancer increases the availability and fault tolerance of your applications.</p>
            <p> You can add and remove compute resources from your load balancer as your needs change, without disrupting the overall flow of requests to your applications.</p>
            <p> You can configure health checks, which monitor the health of the compute resources, so that the load balancer sends requests only to the healthy ones. You can also offload the work of encryption and decryption to your load balancer so that your compute resources can focus on their main work.</p>

        <h2>Accessing Elastic Load Balancing</h2>
        <p>
            You can create, access, and manage your load balancers using any of the following interfaces:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS Management Console— Provides a web interface that you can use to access Elastic Load Balancing.</li>
            <li>AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) — Provides commands for a broad set of AWS services, including Elastic Load Balancing.The AWS CLI is supported on Windows, macOS, and Linux. </li>
            <li>AWS SDKs — Provide language-specific APIs and take care of many of the connection details.such as calculating signatures, handling request retries, and error handling. </li>
            <li>Query API— Provides low-level API actions that you call using HTTPS requests. Using the Query API is the most direct way to access Elastic Load Balancing. However, the Query API requires that your application handle low-level details such as generating the hash to sign the request, and error handling. For more information, see the following:</li>
