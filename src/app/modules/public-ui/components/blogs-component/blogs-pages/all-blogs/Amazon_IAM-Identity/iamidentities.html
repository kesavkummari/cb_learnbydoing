   <header> <h1>IAM Identities (users, user groups, and roles)</h1></header>

    <p>The AWS account root user or an administrative user for the account can create IAM identities. An IAM identity provides access to an AWS account. An IAM user group is a collection of IAM users managed as a unit. An IAM identity represents a human user or programmatic workload, and can be authenticated and then authorized to perform actions in AWS. Each IAM identity can be associated with one or more policies. Policies determine what actions a user, role, or member of a user group can perform, on which AWS resources, and under what conditions.</p>

    <h1>AWS account root user</h1>
    <div class="highlight">
    <p>When you first create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.</p>

        <p><span class="important-text">Important:</span> When you first create an AWS account, you begin with one sign-in identity that has complete access to all AWS services and resources in the account. This identity is called the AWS account root user and is accessed by signing in with the email address and password that you used to create the account.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h1>IAM users</h1>
    <div class="highlight">
    <p>An IAM user is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions for a single person or application. Where possible, best practices recommend relying on temporary credentials instead of creating IAM users who have long-term credentials such as passwords and access keys. Before creating access keys, review the alternatives to long-term access keys. </p>
   
        <p><span class="important-text">Note:</span> As a security best practice, we recommend that you provide access to your resources through identity federation instead of creating IAM users. For information about specific situations where an IAM user is required, see When to create an IAM user (instead of a role).</p>
    </div>
        <h1>IAM User Groups</h1>
        <div class="highlight">
        <p>An IAM group is an identity that specifies a collection of IAM users. You can't use a group to sign-in. You can use groups to specify permissions for multiple users at a time. Groups make permissions easier to manage for large sets of users. For example, you could have a group named IAMPublishers and give that group the types of permissions that publishing workloads typically need.</p>
    </div>
        <h1>IAM Roles</h1>

        <div class="highlight">
        <p>An IAM role is an identity within your AWS account that has specific permissions. It's similar to an IAM user, but isn't associated with a specific person. You can temporarily assume an IAM role in the AWS Management Console by switching roles. You can assume a role by calling an AWS CLI or AWS API operation or by using a custom URL. For more information about methods for using roles, see Using IAM roles.</p>
    
        <p>IAM roles with temporary credentials are used in the following situations:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Federated user access</strong> – </li>
               <p> To assign permissions to a federated identity, you create a role and define permissions for the role. When a federated identity authenticates, the identity is associated with the role and is granted the permissions that are defined by the role. For information about roles for federation, see Creating a role for a third-party Identity Provider in the IAM User Guide. If you use IAM Identity Center, you configure a permission set. To control what your identities can access after they authenticate, IAM Identity Center correlates the permission set to a role in IAM.</p>          
            <li><strong>Temporary IAM user permissions</strong> – </li>
               <p> An IAM user or role can assume an IAM role to temporarily take on different permissions for a specific task.</p>
            <li><strong>Cross-account access</strong> – </li>
               <p>You can use an IAM role to allow someone (a trusted principal) in a different account to access resources in your account. Roles are the primary way to grant cross-account access. However, with some AWS services, you can attach a policy directly to a resource (instead of using a role as a proxy).</p>
            <li><strong>Cross-service access</strong> – </li>
               <p>Some AWS services use features in other AWS services. For example, when you make a call in a service, it's common for that service to run applications in Amazon EC2 or store objects in Amazon S3. A service might do this using the calling principal's permissions, using a service role, or using a service-linked role.</p>
            <li><strong>Principal permissions</strong> – </li>
               <p>When you use an IAM user or role to perform actions in AWS, you are considered a principal. When you use some services, you might perform an action that then initiates another action in a different service. FAS uses the permissions of the principal calling an AWS service, combined with the requesting AWS service to make requests to downstream services. FAS requests are only made when a service receives a request that requires interactions with other AWS services or resources to complete. In this case, you must have permissions to perform both actions.</p>
            <li><strong>Service role</strong> – </li>
              <p> A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM.</p>
            <li><strong>Service-linked role</strong> – </li>
              <p> A service role is an IAM role that a service assumes to perform actions on your behalf. An IAM administrator can create, modify, and delete a service role from within IAM.</p>
            <li><strong>Applications running on Amazon EC2</strong> – </li>
              <p>You can use an IAM role to manage temporary credentials for applications that are running on an EC2 instance and making AWS CLI or AWS API requests. This is preferable to storing access keys within the EC2 instance. To assign an AWS role to an EC2 instance and make it available to all of its applications, you create an instance profile that is attached to the instance. An instance profile contains the role and enables programs that are running on the EC2 instance to get temporary credentials.</p>
        </ul>   
        </div>
        <h1>When to Create an IAM User (instead of a role)</h1>
        <div class="highlight">
        <p>We recommend you only use IAM users for use cases not supported by federated users. Some of the use cases include the following:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Workloads that cannot use IAM roles</strong> – </li>
               <p> You might run a workload from a location that needs to access AWS. In some situations, you can't use IAM roles to provide temporary credentials, such as for WordPress plugins. In these situations, use IAM user long-term access keys for that workload to authenticate to AWS.</p>
            <li><strong>Third-party AWS clients</strong> – </li>
               <p> If you are using tools that don’t support access with IAM Identity Center, such as third-party AWS clients or vendors that aren't hosted on AWS, use IAM user long-term access keys.</p>
            <li><strong>AWS CodeCommit access</strong> – </li>
                <p>If you are using CodeCommit to store your code, you can use an IAM user with either SSH keys or service-specific credentials for CodeCommit to authenticate to your repositories. We recommend that you do this in addition to using a user in IAM Identity Center for normal authentication.Users in IAM Identity Center are the people in your workforce who need access to your AWS accounts or to your cloud applications. To give users access to your CodeCommit repositories without configuring IAM users, you can configure the git-remote-codecommit utility.</p>
            <li><strong>Amazon Keyspaces (for Apache Cassandra) access</strong> – </li>
                <p>In a situation where you are unable to use users in IAM Identity Center, such as for testing purposes for Cassandra compatibility, you can use an IAM user with service-specific credentials to authenticate with Amazon Keyspaces. Users in IAM Identity Center are the people in your workforce who need access to your AWS accounts or to your cloud applications. You can also connect to Amazon Keyspaces using temporary credentials.</p>
            <li><strong>Emergency access</strong> – </li>
                <p>In a situation where you can't access your identity provider and you must take action in your AWS account. Establishing emergency access IAM users can be part of your resiliency plan. We recommend that the emergency user credentials be tightly controlled and secured using multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>
        </ul>
        </div>
         
        <h1>When to Create an IAM Role (instead of a user)</h1>
        <div class="highlight">
        <p>Create an IAM role in the following situations:</p>
    
        <ul>
            <li><span class="important-text">You're creating an application that runs on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance and that application makes requests to AWS.</span></li>
                <p>Don't create an IAM user and pass the user's credentials to the application or embed the credentials in the application. Instead, create an IAM role that you attach to the EC2 instance to give temporary security credentials to applications running on the instance. When an application uses these credentials in AWS, it can perform all of the operations that are allowed by the policies attached to the role.</p>
            <li><span class="important-text"> You're creating an app that runs on a mobile phone and that makes requests to AWS.</span> </li>
                <p>Don't create an IAM user and distribute the user's access key with the app. Instead, use an identity provider like Login with Amazon, Amazon Cognito, Facebook, or Google to authenticate users and map the users to an IAM role. The app can use the role to get temporary security credentials that have the permissions specified by the policies attached to the role. For more information, see the following:    </p>

                <p>2. About web identity federation</p>
 
            <li><span class="important-text">Users in your company are authenticated in your corporate network and want to be able to use AWS without having to sign in again—that is, you want to allow users to federate into AWS.</span> </li>
                <p>Don't create IAM users. Configure a federation relationship between your enterprise identity system and AWS. You can do this in two ways:</p>
                <p>1. If your company's identity system is compatible with SAML 2.0, you can establish trust between your company's identity system and AWS.</p>
                <p>2. Create and use a custom proxy server that translates user identities from the enterprise into IAM roles that provide temporary AWS security credentials. </p>
